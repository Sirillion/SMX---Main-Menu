**Description:**

SMXmenu is a menu conversion modlet. It was made to extend the art style of SMX into the menu UIâ€™s of the game and even though it was made to supplement SMXhud it will also work stand alone for those that just want to modify their menu UI's.

> Dependencies: SMXlib.

> Compatibility: Will probably work with most mods/modlets that doesn't modify the same windows/areas in the XUI files and have a lower load order.
